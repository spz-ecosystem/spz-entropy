# spz-entropy

A high-performance entropy coding library based on the **SPZ v3** algorithm, designed for compatibility with the Khronos `KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression_spz_2` specification.

## Key Features

- **SPZ v3 Core**: Implements the latest SPZ v3 entropy coding algorithm for optimal compression ratio and speed.
- **Khronos Ready**: Designed to be fully compatible with the upcoming `KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression_spz_2` glTF extension.
- **Fast**: Optimized for modern CPUs with SIMD support (AVX2, NEON).
- **Portable**: Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Flexible**: Supports both lossless and lossy entropy coding modes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 or later
- CMake 3.16+
- A modern C++ compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spz-ecosystem/spz-entropy.git
cd spz-entropy
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
